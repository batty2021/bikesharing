# Bikesharing
Create worksheets, dashboards, and stories from New York City bike-sharing data visualization by using the software Tableau.

# Overview of the analysis

# Purpose:
   To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis . For this analysis,
   I used Pandas to change the trip durationn" column from an integer to DateTime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, 
   I created a set of visualizations to:
   - Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
   -  Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
   -  Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

# Summary:

 In terms of starting a bike-sharing company several metrics shouldd be focused on:

 - Location A majority of bikes should be easily accessible, as well as housed at high-traffic locations where they
     are more likely to be checked out and returned.
 - Inventory Bikes will need to be available during peak hours which are generally 5 am-9 am and 4 pm-7 pm. This is due to most of
  the population in the U.Shasg a traditional work schedule.

# Pro :
What I like the most is the ability to dig deep into data to get a better insight.
There are lots of features to take advantage of, and also like community help is always out there if we stalk.

# General con's for Tableau to be fixed from my experience:
Large files take a while to load or Elapse time and sometimes they will crash which is inconvenient.
Since there is no auto-save function, we could lose our work.
